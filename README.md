## AI Prompt Builder

AI Prompt Builder is a desktop utility designed to streamline the creation of detailed, context-rich prompts for large language models (LLMs). It allows you to effortlessly combine multiple source code files, project structures, and specific instructions into a single, perfectly formatted Markdown output, ready to be copied into any AI chat interface.

### Key Features

*   **Template-Based Workflows:** Save your sessions as templates. Each template remembers your files, folders, and the last prompt you used, allowing you to quickly resume your work.
*   **Effortless File Aggregation:**
    *   Add individual files or entire folders.
    *   Simply drag and drop files and folders directly into the application.
*   **Hierarchical File Tree View:** All your added files are organized into a clean, intuitive tree structure that mirrors your project's layout, making it easy to see everything at a glance.
*   **Selective Inclusion:** Easily enable or disable any file or folder using a toggle. This allows you to control exactly which content is included in the final output without permanently removing files from your list.
*   **Automatic Markdown Formatting:** The application automatically generates a clean Markdown output that includes:
    *   The complete content of all enabled files, each within its own fenced code block specifying the language.
    *   A project structure tree to give the AI context of your repository's layout.
*   **AI-Powered Prompt Enhancement:** An "Improve" button helps refine your written prompt by correcting grammar and spelling, ensuring your request is as clear as possible.
*   **Smart Paste:** Quickly update a file's content by copying new code to your clipboard and using the "Smart Paste" feature. It intelligently finds the most similar file in your project and allows you to replace its content with a single click.
*   **Real-time Token Counting:** A live token counter shows you the size of your generated prompt, helping you stay within the context window limits of different AI models.
*   **One-Click Copy:** A dedicated "Copy" button (`Ctrl+Shift+C`) instantly grabs the entire generated Markdown prompt and copies it to your clipboard.
